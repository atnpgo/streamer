// We make use of this 'server' variable to provide the address of the
// REST Janus API. By default, in this example we assume that Janus is
// co-located with the web server hosting the HTML pages but listening
// on a different port (8088, the default for HTTP in Janus), which is
// why we make use of the 'window.location.hostname' base address. Since
// Janus can also do HTTPS, and considering we don't really want to make
// use of HTTP for Janus if your demos are served on HTTPS, we also rely
// on the 'window.location.protocol' prefix to build the variable, in
// particular to also change the port used to contact Janus (8088 for
// HTTP and 8089 for HTTPS, if enabled).
// In case you place Janus behind an Apache frontend (as we did on the
// online demos at http://janus.conf.meetecho.com) you can just use a
// relative path for the variable, e.g.:
//
// 		var server = "/janus";
//
// which will take care of this on its own.
//
//
// If you want to use the WebSockets frontend to Janus, instead, you'll
// have to pass a different kind of address, e.g.:
//
// 		var server = "ws://" + window.location.hostname + ":8188";
//
// Of course this assumes that support for WebSockets has been built in
// when compiling the server. WebSockets support has not been tested
// as much as the REST API, so handle with care!
//
//
// If you have multiple options available, and want to let the library
// autodetect the best way to contact your server (or pool of servers),
// you can also pass an array of servers, e.g., to provide alternative
// means of access (e.g., try WebSockets first and, if that fails, fall
// back to plain HTTP) or just have failover servers:
//
//		var server = [
//			"ws://" + window.location.hostname + ":8188",
//			"/janus"
//		];
//
// This will tell the library to try connecting to each of the servers
// in the presented order. The first working server will be used for
// the whole session.
//
var server = null;
//if (window.location.protocol === 'http:')
//  server = "http://" + window.location.hostname + ":8088/janus";
//else
server = "https://stream.atnpgo.wtf:8089/janus";
